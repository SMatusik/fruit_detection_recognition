# fruit_detection_recognition
Repository includes script, which was a master thesis result.
Main goal was to build and test accuracy of system that is fed with images and detects, localise and recognize fruits.
Fruits were also classified fresh or rotten by another 6 neural networks.

Script is not usable without setting up environment due to research version of TensorFlow Object Detection API.

Some of results are provided at:

In the same folder are trained models (both Keras classification models and TensorFlow object detector)
